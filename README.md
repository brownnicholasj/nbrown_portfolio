## Description

This portfolio page is to serve as a repository to showcase my work for both
personal and professional projects.

- This will be a place I can store my work overtime to allow me to track my
  skills and advancement
- Building this is the first phase of what will adjust and evolve along with my
  coding education.
- Having everything in one location allows me to easily recall, showcase, or
  sunset old works to allow them to serve multiple purposes over time.
- I have updated the portfolio to have a react front end and will continue to
  add within this library.

## Outline

The portfolio page is setup as a one page design to highlight my work, with
links to those pieces of work, when necessary. It gives users the ability to
find/contact me.

I follow a pretty simple, yet accessible layout utilizing semantic tags <br>
'body'<br> &ensp; 'header'<br> &ensp; 'nav'<br> &ensp; 'main'<br> &ensp; &ensp;
'section'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h2'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'article<br>
&ensp; &ensp; 'section'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h2'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;
'article<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h3'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;
'article<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h3'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;
'article<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h3'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;
'article<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h3'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;
'article<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h3'<br> &ensp; &ensp; 'section'<br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'h2'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'figure'<br> &ensp; &ensp;
&ensp; 'figure'<br> &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 'figure'<br> <br>

## Usage

All links within the page will have a shadow upon hover to visibly show
interaction ability.

Styled to mobile screen and increases using @media query.

I originally used a lot of grid to position my site, but I found it caused a lot
more css code to setup and maintain, especially with media queries in place. I
switch a lot of it back to flexbox because it was simpler. I like the control
the grid gives me so eventually I might go back, but there are more
functions/features that might work better for me in the future.
